# Advent of Code 2020 - Deno edition

These are my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) challenge coded using [Deno](https://deno.land) and [Typescript](typescriptlang.org/).

In order to execute the code and test the inputs yourself you'll need to have Deno installed.

Before executing any of the code you should `cd` into the day you wish to run the script or test. After that you can:

- Run `deno run --allow-read="./" ./index.ts` to see the result of the script with the task input
- Run `deno test` to see unit tests for that task (where tests are present)
- Run `deno test --coverage --unstable` to see code coverage for the unit tests for that task (where tests are present)

_note_: To keep it simpler in the script I'm making them local to their respective directory for now so make sure your current dir in the one with an `index.ts` file and the required inputs.
