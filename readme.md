# Advent of Code 2020 - Deno edition

These are my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) challenge coded using [Deno](https://deno.land) and [Typescript](typescriptlang.org/).

In order to execute the code and test the inputs yourself you'll need to have Deno installed.

You can run any of the scripts by doing, eg:

`deno run --allow-read="./inputs" day-01.ts`
